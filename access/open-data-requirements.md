# Open Data Requirements

By law, Service data must be made available to the public and provided in an open format. These requirements help make our data transparent and accessible. This is critically important for maintaining strong partnerships within the scientific community and achieving public accountability.&#x20;

Key **policies** that shape the Service's data requirements include:

* [274 FW 1](https://www.fws.gov/policy/274fw1.html) - Requires creation of data management plans and describes USFWS data management roles and responsibilities.
* [274 FW 2](https://www.fws.gov/policy/274fw2.html) - Describes procedures for developing, adopting, and maintaining Servicewide data standards.
* [Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)](https://www.foia.gov/) - Requires public disclosure of government information upon request, but some exceptions apply.
* [OPEN Government Data Act](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-29) - Requires federal agencies to make all their public data available in open formats.
* [Privacy Act](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2018-title5/pdf/USCODE-2018-title5-partI-chap5-subchapII-sec552a.pdf) - Restricts the release of personally identifiable information. [System of Records Notices (SORNs)](https://www.census.gov/about/policies/privacy/sorn.html) govern what personal information can and cannot be shared.&#x20;
* [Rehabilitation Act, Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) - Necessitates data and digital products to be accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities.&#x20;
