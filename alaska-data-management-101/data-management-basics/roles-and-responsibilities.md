# Roles & Responsibilities

An important first step in managing data is determining individual roles and responsibilities.  This should include identifying contacts for obtaining information on a project, product, or source data.&#x20;

A person or position should be explicitly identified for each of the following roles:

1. **Project Manager**: Within the Service, this role is often synonymous with the projectâ€™s principal investigator, and is responsible for the management of the project and all associated data products as well as ensuring that the project performance is as described in the project investigation and data management plans.  This person serves at the primary point of contact for a project.
2. **Data Steward**: This person is a technical contact for data and related attributes.  This person is responsible for ensuring that data products are clean and tidy and accompanied by complete metadata; project-product associations between metadata records are accurate; data meets quality, security, privacy, and retention standards. This person coordinates with the trustee to develop and maintain a data management plan; develops or complies with existing standards for data; keeps data current and make sure it is preserved once it reaches the end of its lifecycle.
3. **Data Custodian**: The person responsible for the management of the project archive folder and any other online catalog or repository records including ensuring data and metadata are preserved and maintained in accordance with the DMP, assisting data stewards with performing data maintenance activities, and applying and maintaining appropriate access rights to information systems and repositories.  This person is most likely your program data manager or a regional data manager  (Default is Hilmar Maier<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (78).png" alt="" data-size="line">... joke on Hilmar!)
4. **Data Trustee**: This person has the responsibility for ensuring that the allocation of resources (e.g. staff and funding) are adequate to allow for the completion of all aspects of project and its data management. The trustee also has the ultimate responsibility to ensure the application of governance policies relating to the project and its data resources.  This person typically holds an upper-level and/or supervisory position within the Service.

Other roles may include:

* **Principal Investigator:** The principal investigator, like the project manager, is responsible for the management of the project and all associated data products.  This person is also responsible for the intellectual merit of the project and ensuring that the methods, analysis, and results are scientifically sound.&#x20;
* **Data Originator(s)**: This is the person(s) who is generating or collecting data and are responsible for data they collect, author or generate. The data _'originator'_ is responsible for following best practices for the data type and are involved with product metadata creation.

&#x20;**Note**: An individual may fill multiple roles.  The Project manager may also be the data steward for example.  The exception is the Data Trustee, who hold only this single role. &#x20;
