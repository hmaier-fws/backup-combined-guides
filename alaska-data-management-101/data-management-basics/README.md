# Data Management Basics

The Service's scientific data are a trust resource with value beyond its immediate need.  Our agency is committed to the goals of good data stewardship, which requires a commitment to improving all aspects of data management throughout the data's life cycle from planning to archiving.

The benefits of using the data management life cycle approach include:&#x20;

* decision making based on defensible, high-quality scientific information
* practicing more efficient project management
* improving conservation delivery
* increasing operational efficiencies, reduces costs, and improves services
* supporting overall Service mission
* increasing public access to valuable government information.

#### Data Management Fundamentals

Data management fundamentally includes 4 activities:

* Managing [Roles and Responsibilities](roles-and-responsibilities.md)
* Providing [Quality Management](quality-management.md)
* Providing [Documentation](documentation.md) of your work
* Ensuring [Security & Preservation](security-and-preservation/) of assets

#### Data Management Lifecycle Components

The data management life cycle is not linear, but a series of interconnected and iterative processes.  Each of the phases of the life cycle should be visited during the course for your project work.
