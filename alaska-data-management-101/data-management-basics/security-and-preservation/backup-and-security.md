# Backup & Security

Prior to archiving, digital and non-digital data assets must be backed up and secured during project implementation. This safeguards against preventable data loss or corruption.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Backup locations and schedule as well as custom access restrictions applied to project resources **must** be described in your data management plan.
{% endhint %}

#### Backup

Physical documents like field sheets should be digitized. This can be accomplished by scanning them into your computer, taking photos of them using your smartphone, or creating digital analogs of them through Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access, or other programs.

Multiple copies of digital data assets should be made and stored either in a cloud-based location, on a local server, or on a network-attached storage device. Cloud-based storage options include OneDrive, SharePoint, and Microsoft Teams. These platforms, in contrast to local drives, can automatically back up your files.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Service does not consider a file to be sufficiently backed up unless it has **3** copies.
{% endhint %}

#### Security

It is policy to make Service data available to the public (OPEN Government Data Act). However, there may be certain instances when data must be shielded from public access. Sensitive or confidential data must be kept secure by restricting their availability and complying with data encryption and computer security policies.

Justification must be provided in the data management plan when data have restricted access. Justification should cite specific FOIA and controlled unclassified information (CUI) conditions, identify who does/does not have access, and detail when/under what conditions those restrictions apply.

Though some data are not allowed to be publicly shared, their metadata may still be distributed.&#x20;
