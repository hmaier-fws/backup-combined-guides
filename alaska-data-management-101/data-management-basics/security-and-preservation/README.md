# Security & Preservation

With the technology for rapid backup and cloud storage, data loss is completely preventable.  Project data and files (holdings) may be stored on a local computer for ease of access, but should be backed up to network drives or cloud storage or both for security.  Project teams can use shared space to work collaboratively such as from a network drive or online environment like Teams or OneDrive.  See the recommended file structure described in [File Organization and Best Practices](broken-reference) section for recommendations.

Preservation is the process of ensuring that data and associated metadata are securely maintained such that integrity of data is upheld into the future.  In the Alaska region, completed metadata and clean data products are preserved in the [Regional Data Repository](../../alaska-region-data-repository.md).  Form there, metadata may be shared with other catalogs and data repositories.  The Data Custodian (i.e. data manager) has write permissions to all archive folders. The Project Manager and Data Originators (those who collect and clean data) will have write permissions to an “incoming” folder and read-only permissions to all other folders.  All other staff in the Region will have read-only access to the entire Regional Data Repository.  The incoming folder allows project personnel to contribute products and associated metadata records to the archive folder. &#x20;

Anyone with access to the Regional Data Repository can copy an archive folder to their local hard drive and maintain the files on their hard drive in whatever manner they choose, but only project personnel may move items into their project's archive folder via the incoming folder.
