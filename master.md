### Introduction

This manual describes the **INTERIM** requirements and best practices for the creation of high-quality and consistent metadata records for projects and products from the Alaska Region (AK-Region) of the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). These metadata requirements conform to the standard metadata formats and best practices. (and will be approved by the Alaska Region Data Stewardship Team (DST)) The metadata guidance ensures that AK-Region FWS projects and products are documented, discoverable, accessible, and re-usable.

The Alaska Region of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is committed to improving the management of its data resources. A comprehensive, long-term plan to develop and implement a Regional Data Management System (RDMS) began in the spring of 2020, with the expectation that it will be fully operational and in use in 3-5 years. In the interim, there is a strong desire in the Region to begin managing existing and new data resources with the systems available to staff now. This manual will be continually revised and updated following developments from the RDMS and the National FWS Enterprise Data Management efforts.

#### Metadata and mdEditor

The mdEditor is a metadata editing tool originally created to support the metadata requirements for USFWS Landscape Conservation Cooperatives as an extension of an initiative by the Alaska Data Integration Working Group ([ADIwg](https://adiwg.gitbooks.io/mdeditor/content/GLOSSARY.html#adiwg)). This tool was adopted by the AK-Regional Directorate Team, on the recommendation of the DST, to support the AK-Region's goal of improving data management.

This manual refers to the creation of AK-Region metadata specifically. If you want information on the creation of other types of metadata records using mdEditor, or for more information in general, please refer to the [mdEditor User Manual](https://guide.mdeditor.org).

### Who Should Use this Manual

This guide is for anyone creating or updating metadata for AK-Region projects and products for archiving in the folders of the [Regional Data Repository (RDR)](alaska-data-management-101/alaska-region-data-repository.md). Guidance applies to science projects and products that were conducted or funded by the Fisheries and Ecological Services (FES), Migratory Bird Management (MBM), National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS), Office of Subsistence Management (OSM) or Science Applications (SA) programs of the Alaska Region.

mdEditor is also undergoing constant development. Due to this, there may be minor discrepancies between screenshots in the manual and the current production version of mdEditor.
