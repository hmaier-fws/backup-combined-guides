# Open File Formats

To allow maximum accessibility, data assets should be in open file formats. Open formats have the advantage of being freely available and software independent, making them interoperable. During project implementation, data can be stored in the most convenient format but should be converted to an open format for sharing or long-term storage.

The following file formats, organized according to commonly used data types, are considered open:

| Data type  | Open file format          |
| ---------- | ------------------------- |
| Tabular    | CSV, TSV, TXT             |
| Text       | HTML, PDF, TXT, XML       |
| Image      | JPEG, PNG, TIFF, BMP, SVG |
| Geospatial | SHP, DBF, GeoTIFF, NetCDF |
