# File Naming Conventions

When naming project files, there are some best practices that should be kept in mind that will make file organization and discovery easier. These recommendations will ensure you create both human- and machine-readable file names.

* Keep names short but meaningful.
* Use ISO date format: YYYY, YYYYMM, or YYYYMMDD. It ensures that files with the same name and different dates are sorted in order.
* Avoid using “draft," “version," or “final” in file names. Use date (in ISO format) to distinguish versions.
* When using personal names, give the family name first followed by the first name or initials (e.g., SmithMary, SmithMC).
* Use only letters, numbers, dashes (-), and underscores (\_). Do not use spaces or special characters.
