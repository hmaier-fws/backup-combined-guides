# Update Metadata

In the [Plan](broken-reference) phase of the data management lifecycle, you selected a metadata standard and began creating metadata for your proposed data products. Now is the time to revisit the initiated metadata records, update them as necessary, and create any additional records to ensure your project is well documented.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is **highly recommended** that you regularly update your data management plan and metadata throughout the data management lifecycle. This will save you time and labor in the long run.
{% endhint %}

To update your metadata, follow the steps listed below:

1. Access the "metadata" sub-folder in your project's RDR folder. There should be two folders contained therein: "mdEditor" and "mdJSON." You will want to navigate to the "mdEditor" folder.
2. There should be a single file in your "mdEditor" folder. This file contains your initiated metadata records. Save a copy of this file to your computer.
3. Open a web browser and navigate to [mdEditor](https://www.mdeditor.org/), a digital tool for authoring and editing metadata.&#x20;
4. In the primary navigation, click on "Import."
5. Drag and drop the file containing the initiated metadata records into the blue space.
6. Click the green "Click to Import" button on the right-hand side of your screen.
7. Proceed to edit your metadata records and data dictionaries as needed.
8. Export your updated records as a single .JSON file using the "Export All" function, and upload the file into the "incoming" sub-folder in your project's RDR folder.
