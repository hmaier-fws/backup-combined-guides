# mdEditor basics

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (36).png>)

A complete metadata file for a project is composed of a project metadata record, metadata records for each product produced by the project, the contact information for individuals identified as having a role in the project (or metadata creation for the project), and, if there are tabular datasets, data dictionaries. These are each entered separately in mdEditor and are linked together either by selecting relevant records (for contacts and data dictionaries) or by creating associations (between projects and products).

One [mdEditor JSON file](broken-reference) that contains all of these records is created for each project by starting with a project record and adding product records.&#x20;

## Metadata records <a href="#projects" id="projects"></a>

### Project records

A **project** encompasses a discrete effort on a particular topic with defined goals or objectives. As an interim goal, target projects to undergo data management are science projects whose topics and resulting products have value to partners or the public being able to discover, access, and potentially use them.&#x20;

Consult the [Project Entry Guidance](broken-reference) for step-by-step instructions on creating a Project record.&#x20;

Relationships between a project and its products can be established using the [Associated Tab](broken-reference).&#x20;

### Product records

A **product** is a distinct unit of recorded information generated by experiments, models, simulations and observations. It is usually, but not necessarily, developed as an output from a project. Not every output of a project is necessarily a product requiring a metadata record. For example, meeting minutes do not have standalone value as a publicly-available resource.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
With the exception of administrative records, all products committed to the project's archive folder should be documented with a metadata record.
{% endhint %}

Consult the [Product Entry Guidance](broken-reference) for step-by-step instructions on creating a Product record.&#x20;

Relationships between a product and the project it derived from can be established using the [Associated Tab](broken-reference).&#x20;

## Contacts <a href="#contacts" id="contacts"></a>

A contact is an individual or organization associated with projects and products.&#x20;

Specific roles for each contact (e.g., principal investigator, collaborator, data custodian) are defined within the respective project and product records. A contact can have different roles in different projects or in different products within the same project.

Projects and products always have at least one point of contact.

Consult the [contacts](broken-reference) section for information on the contacts record and guidance on adding new contacts.

## Data Dictionaries

A data dictionary provides information on the attributes (also known as variables, columns, or fields) of products such as tabular data, databases, or geodatabases. Among other things, the information in a data dictionary defines each attribute and describes constraints to the values supplied to each attribute, how null values are to be interpreted, and what coded values represent.

Data dictionaries are [described](broken-reference) and then linked to the product records they support using the [Dictionary Tab](broken-reference). A data dictionary can be used for more than one product record.
