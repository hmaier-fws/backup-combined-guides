# How to get Help & Report Bugs

## Where to Get Help



There are a lot of new concepts introduced here. There are also many steps involved in writing metadata for a project and its products and managing that metadata in the archive folder. There are a few good places to look for answers or ask questions.

1. This guide is a partner guide to the [Alaska Region Interim Data Management User Guide](https://ak-region-dst.gitbook.io/alaska-region-interim-data-management-user-guide/).
2. The [Alaska Early Adopter Team Discussion Boards](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a4b44ca0cecc147f287591f25f55a3a6b%40thread.skype/conversations?groupId=f2bccb15-7613-446e-9cd2-ce1cf171f5d5\&tenantId=0693b5ba-4b18-4d7b-9341-f32f400a5494). You should be added to this Team when you establish an archive folder for your project with your DST member.&#x20;
3. Your regional data manager
4. Your program data manager

## Reporting Bugs and Issues

mdEditor is undergoing constant development. If you think there is a bug in the program, this can be reported at [https://github.com/adiwg/mdEditor/issues](https://github.com/adiwg/mdEditor/issues) or brought to the attention of your DST member. This is not the location to ask questions about the processes outlined here.&#x20;
