# Metadata Standards Reference

The following pages describe the minimum metadata fields for the Alaska Region Metadata Standard 2022 update.  Required fields are from the mdJSON standard and are organized by their location within mdEditor. Please refer to the Alaska Region Metadata Guide for guidance on implementing these minimum standards and using mdEditor.

{% hint style="warning" %}
These minimum content standards should be used in combination with other metadata requirements that apply to the data. Some data types, such as geospatial data, have additional metadata requirements.
