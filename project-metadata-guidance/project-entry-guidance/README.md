# Project Metadata Guidance

The Project Metadata Guidance section will cover how to create a metadata record for a science project.

## Before You Begin

### **Adjust your mdEditor** [**S**](../settings.md)[**ettings**](../settings.md)**:**

**Metadata Repositories**: Make sure your default settings are correct. See Settings.

### **Select the Project Profile**:

After creating your project record initially and before you begin adding metadata, select **Project** from the **Profile** drop-down in the main menu. This will limit the number of available tabs and only show tabs that contain fields that are applicable to project metadata.  Alternatively, some regions or programs have profiles that can be imported into mdEditor.  See Settings for how to do this. &#x20;

### **Update your contacts in mdEditor:**

In mdEditor, contacts are created separately from science metadata records and then stored in mdEditor. Once contacts have been entered or imported into mdEditor, they can be used in any metadata records.

To reduce unnecessary duplication of contacts, Alaska region has a master seed contacts list that include government agencies and partners that are often affiliated with USFWS projects and products. This file is located in the top directory of the Regional Data Repository.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
Having duplicate copies of the same contact is not desirable. It can create confusion as you edit and manage your metadata records and introduce unnecessary errors.
{% endhint %}

## Edit a Project

### Import an Existing Project

If you are updating an existing metadata record, you should import the mdEditor mdJSON file from the project's folder in the Regional Data Repository. Learn how to import files into mdEditor on the [Import ](broken-reference)page.&#x20;

### Create a New Project

1. Create a new Project record by clicking the plus (**+**) sign by **Metadata Records** in the left-hand menu.
2. Provide the name of the project in **Record Title**. Choose "project" as the **Resource Type** Click save.
3. Select the Project Profile: from the Main Menu (Top Navigation Bar) select "**Project"** from the profile drop-down menu.
4. Fill out metadata information for the following tabs:
   * Main Tab
   * Metadata Tab
   * Keywords Tab
   * Taxonomy Tab
   * Extent Tab
   * Documents Tab
   * Funding Tab
5. If applicable, associate your project with other metadata records.
