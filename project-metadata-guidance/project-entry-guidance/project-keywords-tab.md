# Project Keywords Tab

Discoverability is one of the most crucial aspects of open data. One of the simplest and most effective ways to increase the discoverability of your items is to assign the items appropriate keywords, also sometimes called 'tags'.  Adding keywords to your metadata record allows the record to be found in search engines. The mdEditor application is designed using thesauri that contain pre-defined keywords. These thesauri create a 'controlled vocabulary' so that all staff adding metadata can adhere to the same standards, and future searches can consistently return similar results.  A custom thesaurus can also be used.

### GCMD Science Keywords (Required)

GCMD stands for Global Change Master Directory and these keywords are maintained by NASA. Search for relevant and useful keywords in the GCMD Science Keywords. There are GCMD Platforms and Instruments Keyword thesaurus as well.  At least one GCMD keyword is required.

### ISO Topic Category (Required for spatial data)

Because mdJSON metadata is based on the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) metadata standard, a project should select at least one ISO Topic Category.  ISO topics are required for spatial data.  mdEditor provides definitions of each ISO topic category if you hover over the '?' icon. &#x20;

FDGC provides guidance on [geospatial metadata standards](https://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/geospatial-metadata-standards).

'Biota' and 'environment' are probably the best fit for most FWS projects.

## How to Add Keywords

1. Click “+ Add Thesaurus” on the right to add the different thesauruses.
2. Choose the desired thesaurus from the list of options.
3. Select desired keywords from the following pre-populated thesauruses.
4. If none of the keywords are sufficient for tagging your project, you can add other keywords with a custom thesaurus.

## Custom Thesaurus

If any of your desired keywords do not appear in the existing thesauruses, you can add them via the custom thesaurus. Use a custom thesaurus only for keywords that are not available in an existing thesaurus.  Users cannot add keywords to an existing thesaurus; you can only add keywords in a custom thesaurus.&#x20;
