# Master Contact List

Contacts involved in a project or product are referenced in the metadata records. Contact information can include an email address, physical address, website, and/or phone number so that viewers of metadata can communicate with those affiliated with a metadata record. In the metadata records, you assign a role to each contact.&#x20;

Instead of creating contacts separately for project and product records, the Alaska region has created a master contact list.  This mdJSON file is stored in a contacts folder in the top level of the Regional Data Repository (RDR). This file is maintained and updated by your Data Manager Team.&#x20;

Once contacts are imported into mdEditor, they can be used in any metadata record.  It is good practice to review some contacts for accuracy in mdEditor before creating or editing your metadata records.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you load the Contacts file and see that there is no record for a person or position that you need for your metadata, you may either contact your Data Manager to add that person to the master contacts file or [create a new contact record](broken-reference) and submit the record to your Data Manager for inclusion into the master contacts file.&#x20;
