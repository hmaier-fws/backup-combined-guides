# Product Metadata Guidance

The Product Metadata Guidance section covers how to create a metadata record for a product.  A product can be anything from a dataset to a document or presentation to program script or model. mdEditor offers an extensive list of product options, of which "_product_" should never be used.&#x20;

## Before You Begin

### Adjust your mdEditor Settings, as needed:

### Select the Product Profile:

After creating your product record initially and before you begin editing metadata, select a profile.   **Product** may be chosen from the **Profile** drop down in the main menu.  A profile limits the available tabs and only shows tabs that contain fields that are required for product creation. Additionally, often a profile also limits the fields from view for a specific type of metadata record--in this case a product record.  For example, funding is not needed for a product and this tab is hidden.&#x20;

The Alaska region has a metadata profiles available to help guide metadata creation.  [See Profiles and Schemas](../project-metadata-guidance/profiles-and-schemes.md).

### Update your contacts in mdEditor, as needed:

In mdEditor, contacts are created separately from individual records, and then stored within a contact library. Once contacts have been entered or imported into mdEditor, they can be used in any metadata records.  The Alaska region maintains a master contact list for import that can be found in a file folder in the top level of the [Regional Data Repository](../alaska-data-management-101/alaska-region-data-repository.md).  See [Contact Entry Guidance](../project-metadata-guidance/contact-entry-guidance/).

## Edit a Product

### Import an Existing Product

If you are updating an existing metadata record, you should import the mdEditor mdJSON file from the project's folder in the Regional Data Repository. Learn how to import files into mdEditor on the [Import ](broken-reference)page.&#x20;

### Create a New Product

1. Create a new Product record by clicking the plus (**+**) sign by **Metadata Records** in the left-hand menu.
2. Provide a descriptive name for the product in **Record** **Title**. Choose the specific **Resource Type** that describes your product. Do not choose the generic "product." Click save.
3. Select the Product Profile: from the Main Menu (Top Navigation Bar) select "**Product"** from the profile drop-down menu.
4. Fill out metadata information for the following tabs:
   * Product Main Tab
   * Product Metadata Tab
   * Product Keywords Tab
   * Product Taxonomy Tab
   * Product Extent Tab
   * Product Lineage Tab
   * Product Distribution Tab
   * Product Constraints Tab
   *   If applicable, associate your products with other metadata records from the Associated Tab and Dictionaries Tab.
