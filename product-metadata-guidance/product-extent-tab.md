# Product Extent Tab

Extent refers to the location or geographic boundaries for your dataset. Spatial extents lets users see at a glance the geographic footprint of your data and enables searching within specific geographic areas. **Extents are a best practice for most project and product records, but are required for "geograhicDataset" products**. As a default, products may inherit extents from their project.&#x20;

Adding an Extent for Products is the same process as for Projects. Please see the [Project Extent Tab.](../project-metadata-guidance/project-entry-guidance/project-extent-tab.md)
