# Initiate Metadata

The planning phase is the ideal time to initiate metadata for your project and proposed data products. Metadata - or data about data - is crucial for making sure your data is documented, findable, and reusable.&#x20;

Metadata is officially defined as "structural or descriptive information about data such as content, format, source, rights, accuracy, provenance, frequency, periodicity, granularity, contact information, publisher or responsible party, method of collection, and other descriptions" (44 U.S.C 3502). It provides critical information, such as data content and quality, points of contact, where the data are stored, and use limitations and restrictions among other things. Posting metadata to metadata catalogs (e.g., data.gov) allows other users to search for datasets.&#x20;

### Planning metadata

The first step to initiating metadata for projects and products is to choose an applicable metadata standard. The metadata standard you choose will depend on what type of data you are describing and what data repository you will be using. For example, geospatial data must be described with Federal Geographic Data Committee-compliant metadata (i.e. FGDC CSDGM, ISO 191xx series). Regardless of the standard used, the data management policy requires that metadata be: (a) created in a machine-readable and open format, (b) adequately described, (c) updated throughout the lifecycle of the data, and (d) preserved alongside the data.&#x20;

The Alaska Region has developed a [metadata standard checklist](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-Lg8RlbvpdNt6sN74m1-/alaska-region-tools/metadata-standard-checklist) that staff can refer to in order to meet minimum content requirements.

For non-geospatial metadata, the Alaska Region data management staff recommend using the mdJSON standard, which can be created using mdEditor. Guidance on using mdEditor can be found in the [Alaska Region Metadata Guide](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-Lg8RheXiHlVObKY-2tL/s/-Lg8RlbvpdNt6sN74m1-/).
