# Establish Roles and Responsibilities

When planning for data management, it is important to keep staff expectations and responsibilities in mind. The data management policy ([274 FW 1](https://www.fws.gov/policy/274fw1.html#\_3dy6vkm)) lays out the following responsibilities for all staff.

### Staff Expectations and Responsibilities

#### Responsibilities for managers/supervisors

Managers and supervisors ensure employees under their supervision practice good data management. This may include ensuring employees have data management duties in their performance plans, encouraging employees to participate in Service-wide data management initiatives, and ensuring employees have the necessary training, skills, and resources to manage data. They may serve as a Data Trustee for new data collections and acquisitions or assign others to this role.

#### Responsibilities for all staff

All USFWS staff are responsible for following applicable data management-related laws, regulations, policies, and best practices. Staff must fulfill the responsibilities of any data management roles (below) to which they are assigned, and they must handle data in accordance with applicable access and user restrictions. Staff should inform their managers or supervisors about training that they need in order to follow data management best practices and policies.

### Key Data Management Roles

When planning data management for a specific project or endeavor, there are a number of key data management roles that need to be filled.

#### Data Trustee&#x20;

The data trustee is responsible for ensuring adequate resources are available to properly manage data throughout its lifecycle. Trustees ensure data are covered by a data management plan, assign data stewards and custodians for the data, and make sure that data management personnel are following the data management plan.

#### Data Steward

The data steward is the technical point of contact for the data and in charge of ensuring data quality, security, privacy, and retention. They are responsible for coordinating with the data trustee to develop, maintain, and implement data management plans and resolve issues associated with the data. They coordinate with the data custodian and producers to keep data current and ensure their preservation. They guarantee the quality of the metadata and may be involved in their creation.

#### Data Custodian&#x20;

The data custodian is responsible for ensuring data and metadata are preserved and maintained in accordance with the data management plan and in a manner that is resilient to changes in staff, technology, and policy. Data custodians assist data stewards with performing data maintenance activities and reviewing or updating metadata. This role is often filled by your program's data manager.

#### Data Producer/Originator&#x20;

The data producers are the individuals that create and maintain the data. Data producers follow the guidance set out in the data management plan and may be involved in the creation of metadata. You may see the terms "data producer" and "data originator" used interchangeably.
