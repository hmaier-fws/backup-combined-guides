# Data Management Plan Templates

There are currently three data management plan templates available for staff in the Alaska Region to use. Using the Alaska Regional or FES DMP template and submitting it to your program data manager will initiate the process of creating a [folder in the Regional Data Repository](../../../alaska-data-management-101/alaska-region-data-repository.md) for your project.

### The Alaska Regional Data Management Plan

The Alaska Regional DMP template was created for use in any program in the Alaska Region. This template is a fillable Microsoft Word form that collects project and product information with the intention of automating metadata creation for staff. This template is strongly recommended for staff in Migratory Birds Management (MBM), Science Applications (SA), and National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS).&#x20;

Guidance for completing this plan can be found on the [following page](alaska-regional-data-management-plan-template.md).

### The Fisheries and Ecological Services Data Management Plan

This fillable Microsoft Word form template was developed for use by Fisheries and Ecological Services (FES) staff. This template is less extensive than the Regional DMP template and does not automate metadata creation. FES staff are encouraged to use this template or the Alaska Regional Data Management Plan.&#x20;

### The National Data Management Plan Template

This form is the recommended template from the Headquarters data management team.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Due to the current difficulty of sharing, reviewing, and updating plans created with this form, staff should **NOT** create a DMP using this form without first consulting with Alaska Region data management staff.
{% endhint %}

Alaska Region data management staff will ensure that this headquarters requirement is fulfilled when either an Alaska Region or FES DMP is filled out.
