# Best Practices for File Organization

There is a distinction between working folders and archive folders; development of the latter is the focus of this document. Working folders often exist on an individualâ€™s computer hard drive and are used to collect, organize, and analyze products during the course of the project. In contrast, we use archive folders to store products that need to be retained over time. The products in the archive folders are the subject of metadata records to ensure that they are discoverable.&#x20;

Consistent archive folder organization across projects and programs allows the file creator, collaborators, supervisors, and our future colleagues to find relevant documents associated with a project quickly and understand how documents relate to one another. The RDR tree structure is described below.&#x20;

To initiate a new project archive folder, contact your program data manager. If the project has a completed data management plan, then a folder structure in the [Regional Data Repository](../alaska-data-management-101/alaska-region-data-repository.md) has been created and they can give you the address to access the incoming folder. Folder names use a short acronym for your program, followed by a three-digit number, followed by the short title of the project (e.g., FESFRP\_001\_BarrowEider where FES FRP stands for FES Fairbanks Recovery Program). The Security and Preservation section of this guide discusses access to this record.

_Structure and details of the file/folder contents are below._&#x20;

**root** folder is the project name; takes the format ProgramAcronym\_SequentialNumber\_ShortTitle, e.g., MBMWA\_011\_YKDeltaNestPlot would stand for the Migratory Bird Management Waterfowl Program, YK  Delta Nest Plot Survey, and it was the 11th archive record created for that program.  Documents found in this folder may include a human-readable project summary report, project data management plan (.pdf), and the change log (.txt).

* **changelog.txt** is a text file for the data custodian to record project activities related to the archive record
* **admin** folder contains material related to general project administration; could be replicated each year for multiyear projects (i.e., admin2019, admin2020)
  * **contracts** folder contains executed contracts associated with the project ****
  * **correspondence** folder including permits obtained for the project and any other relevant correspondence
  * **proposals** folder houses proposals prepared for both internal and external funding, whether successful or not
  * **purchasing** folder includes significant or unique purchasing information that is deemed important to archive for budget justification purposes
  * **training** folder houses any training materials developed for the project
  * **travel** folder includes significant or unique travel information that is deemed important to archive for budget justification purposes
* **code** folder contains completed computer coding or scripts with notations that were essential for the project.  This does NOT need to include scripts that were used for data cleaning or tidying (i.e. R or Python scripts)
* **documents** (materials generated by the project; these products are also documented in metadata)
  * **images** (stand-alone posters, maps, drawings, pictures)
  * **publications** (peer reviewed)
  * **reports** (not peer reviewed)
  * **talks** (presentations)
*   **data** folder houses the output of your work (ie. your data!!)  This is any and all data types like tables, images, vocalization recordings, geospatial points and lines, etc.

    * **raw data** files are unprocessed and represent the data as it was collected.  This is saved if/when an error is found in the processed data, the original data can be used to make the correction.
    * **final data** files are the processed, tidy, and clean data that is documented in the metadata record and is shared for re-use.

    A Best practice is to name the raw and final data as such and to mirror the subsequent    data file naming.  ie.  rawYellowFootCounts2021(.csv), finalYellowFootCounts2021(.csv)
* **incoming** folder is the waiting room for materials that should be filed under one of the other branches after review by the data custodian (aka data manager)
* **metadata** folder contains the completed mdEditor metadata JSON file for the project, and its associated products, contacts, and data dictionaries.
* **protocols** houses methods and protocol documents used for the project.
  * form\_templates may be included for reference (i.e**.** data sheets, templates for data entry, etc)
* **source\_data** is data that was used for the project, but NOT generated by the project.  This data should be cited in the methods, in any publications or project presentations.  It is best practice to archive your source data since the original source may change with updates.  ie. sourceLandCover2021(.tiff), source\_PctOaksKodiak2021(.shp)&#x20;
